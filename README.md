javascript_dynamic table

Using information collected from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, and D3.js I created a scatter plot comparing age to the number of smokers by state. Using javascript I added a scatter plot to an existing webpage. I then added the state abbreviations to each circle and a pop-up tool-tip when you hover over the circle that displays the state, number of smokers and average age.
